# QuickApply
Our project aims to streamline the college admissions process by reducing the need for students to reach out to admissions offices and decreasing wait times. According to our surveys, 90% of students struggle with the admissions process and find it challenging to comprehend. Our project seeks to simplify the process, enabling students to determine their eligibility for college and financial aid before applying. We have observed that a significant number of students fail to apply due to colleges' inability to handle online applications. Our solution can assist colleges in increasing the number of applicants and simplifying the arduous admissions process. Our model predicts that this initiative will generate more revenue by encouraging students to apply online.
